CH Open Data Stories
---

We would like to stimulate a Community of Practice within government administrations that are working with Open Data, as well as industry partners, research teams, and other stakeholder groups, with Stories and Resources. 

As an initial low hanging fruit, we have created a news feed which complements the Dataset publications and Newsletter produced by BFS / opendata.swiss, the Blog of Opendata.ch, social media hashtags prevalent in our community. 

Our initial focus is to cast a light on positive and negative examples of the publication and application of Open Government Data. We hope to test the interest with a website and crowdfunding, and create a platform for useful automatic aggregation, community content, and journalistic work.

Our initial prototype was made using Feedly at the <a href="https://www.bfh.ch/de/aktuell/fachveranstaltungen/weiterbildung-data-management-und-open-government-data/" target="_blank">Weiterbildung Data Management und Open Government Data</a> (Bern - 21.1.2023), along with this small webpage to describe the idea.
